//big-oh rule book
rule1: worst case
	rule2: remove constants
		rule3: different terms for inputs
			rule4: drop non dominants

example for worst case: for finding an element in an array, if element is at 0 index best case is O(1), if at last index the worst case is O(n),always consider worst case in terms of
scalability.
